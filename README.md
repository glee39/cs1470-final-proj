Welcome to our final project for Going Merry team in Deep Learning!

This is our implementation of YOLO's object detection model.

Ours is not real time, we just used it on still images. It is split into three main files: preprocessing, the main file (containing the model, the training code, and testing code), and the visualization code file.
